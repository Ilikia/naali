<h2>SceneInteract</h2>

Transforms generic mouse and keyboard input events to input-related entity action for scene entities and Qt signals. 
Performs a raycast to the mouse position each frame and executes entity actions depending on the result.

Owned by SceneAPI.

<b>Local entity actions executed to the hit entity:</b>
<ul>
<li>"MouseHoverIn" - Executed when mouse hover enters the entity.
<div>No parameters.</div>
<li>"MouseHover" - Executed when mouse hovers on the entity.
<div>No parameters</div>
<li>"MouseHoverOut" - Executed when mouse hover leaves the entity.
<div></div>
<li>"MousePress" - Executed when mouse is clicked on the entity.
<div>String parameters: (int)"Qt::MouseButton", (float,float,float)"x,y,z", (int)"submesh index"</div>
<li>
<div></div>
<li>
<div></div>
</ul>

<b>Qt signals emitted by SceneInteract object:</b>
<ul>
<li>EntityClicked(Entity*, Qt::MouseButton, RaycastResult*) - Emitted when mouse is clicked on the entity.
<div>Parameters: hit entity, clicked mouse button, raycast result or the hit.</div>
