/// A 3-by-3 matrix for linear transformations of 3D geometry.
/** This matrix can represent any kind of linear transformations of 3D geometry, which include rotation, 
    scale, shear, mirroring and orthographic projection. A 3x3 matrix cannot represent translation (which requires
    a 3x4 matrix), or perspective projection (which requires a 4x4 matrix).

    The elements of this matrix are

        m_00, m_01, m_02
        m_10, m_11, m_12
        m_20, m_21, m_22

    The element m_yx is the value on the row y and column x.
    You can access m_yx using the double-bracket notation m[y][x], or using the member function m.At(y, x);

    @note The member functions in this class use the convention that transforms are applied to vectors in the form 
    M * v. This means that "float3x3 M, M1, M2; M = M1 * M2;" gives a transformation M that applies M2 first, followed
    by M1 second, i.e. M * v = M1 * M2 * v = M1 * (M2 * v). This is the convention commonly used with OpenGL. The
    opposing convention (v * M) is commonly used with Direct3D.

    @note This class uses row-major storage, which means that the elements are packed in memory in order 
     m[0][0], m[0][1], m[0][2], m[0][3], m[1][0], m[1][1], ...
    The elements for a single row of the matrix hold successive memory addresses. This is the same memory layout as 
     with C++ multidimensional arrays.

    Contrast this with column-major storage, in which the elements are packed in the memory in 
    order m[0][0], m[1][0], m[2][0], m[3][0], m[0][1], m[1][1], ...
    There the elements for a single column of the matrix hold successive memory addresses. 
    This is exactly opposite from the standard C++ multidimensional arrays, since if you have e.g.
    int v[10][10], then v[0][9] comes in memory right before v[1][0]. ( [0][0], [0][1], [0][2], ... [1][0], [1][1], ...) */
